Howdy, Time-Weary Wrangler!
Tired of NPCs moseying through your epic showdowns like they're on molasses time? Broken Clock ain't just a glitch—it's a curse! Every tick of that fateful clock (at 10:30 PM in-game, because nothing says "spooky" like bedtime) hits every citizen with a 60-second time hex. Watch the whole dang town slow to a crawl: Bandits fumble their six-shooters, barmaids pour drinks in eternal slo-mo, and your horse? It's basically a statue with separation anxiety.
But fear not, cursed cowboy! If the stars ain't aligned for the big tick (or you just wanna prank your posse), whip out the magical cursed watch item. One use, and bam—personal time warp. Because nothing screams "I'm the boss of chronology" like turning a street brawl into a interpretive dance.
Fair Warning: This curse don't discriminate. Your grandma's ghost might join the party (5% chance), or time might skip ahead like it overslept. Side effects: Uncontrollable urges to hum "The Final Countdown" during freezes. Not liable for "temporal whiplash" lawsuits.

Saddle Up: How to Unleash the Tick-Tock Terror

Wait for the Witching Hour: Config's set for 22:30 in-game. When the clock chimes (eerie sound cue incoming), the curse drops. 60 seconds of sweet, sweet slowdown for all NPCs in active zones (Valentine, Saint Denis—your RP hotspots).
Item Hack for Impatient Outlaws: Score a cursed_watch from your black-market mystic (or admin spawn). Pop it like bad moonshine—triggers a local curse bubble. You? Normal speed. Everyone else? Crawling through honey.
Survive the Hex: Blurry premonition warns ya (3s tease), then tick—spectator cam kicks in, clock echoes haunt your dreams. 60s later: Screen shakes, reality reboots. Yell "Not yet, Death!" for bonus points.
Pro Move: Use during a train robbery. "Gentlemen, the law's comin'... but traffic's a nightmare today."

Commands: For When the Curse Needs a Nudge (Or a Nap)

/cursedwatch – Activate your pocket apocalypse. (Console-safe for admins; item optional.)
/resetclock – "Abort mission!" Debug nuke for timeline meddlers. Use sparingly, or you'll summon the time police.
